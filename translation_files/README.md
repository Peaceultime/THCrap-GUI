# Translation
You can start translating Thcrap in a new language by copying the `blank` folder. The `lang.json`
file contain all the English translations of the game, except for the game infos (in the game tab).
You just have to replace the English translations by your translations. You can also add articles
for the game infos (still in the game tab) by editing the `posts.json`. Beware that this file allow
markdown. Finally, in `imgs`, you can add pictures for the different games, this is optional but
allow you to put translated screenshots for exemple and the flag for the language tab.
